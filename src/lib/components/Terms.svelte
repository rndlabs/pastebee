					<h1>PASTEBEE USER TESTING TERMS AND CONDITIONS (JUNE 2021)</h1>
					<p>
						Welcome to Pastebee, currently being developed and graciously provided by the
						1up.digital (“We”). Swarm is a peer-to-peer network of nodes that collectively provide a
						decentralized storage and communication service. Pastebee is currently provided for
						testing purposes only.
					</p>

					<p>By testing Pastebee, you accept the following terms:</p>

					<p>
						We make, at our sole discretion, Pastebee available to you at no charge. You may choose
						to try Pastebee at your sole discretion. Pastebee testing is intended for evaluation
						purposes only and not for production use. It is currently not supported.
					</p>

					<p>
						Data storage and transfer through Pastebee is not encrypted. Data storage through
						Pastebee is not guaranteed in time and data may thus disappear, respectively be erased,
						at any time. Data storage through Pastebee is decentralized and data can thus be stored
						in any jurisdiction by any peer user (node operator).
					</p>

					<p>
						In addition, for the testing of Pastebee, you agree to not upload and transfer personal
						data and data that contain legally protected contents (including professional secrets).
						You agree to not use Pastebee in a way that threatens the security, integrity or
						availability of the service. In particular, you shall not use Pastebee to (i) store
						and/or transfer infringing, libelous, or otherwise unlawful or tortious material, (ii)
						store and/or transfer material in violation of third-party privacy rights, (iii) store
						and/or transfer malicious code, (iv) interfere with or disrupt the integrity or
						performance of any third-party service or data. You are solely responsible for the
						uploaded and downloaded files. You may only upload and/or transfer files that belong to
						you and/or that you are explicitly authorized to upload and/or transfer. You agree to
						defend, indemnify and hold harmless Swarm, as well as any and all persons involved in
						the provision of Pastebee with respect to all claims, demands, liabilities, costs and/or
						expenses resulting from an illegal use of Pastebee or its content.
					</p>

					<p>
						You acknowledge that Pastebee is not free from bugs or errors and that Swarm bears no
						liability for any harm or damage arising out of or in connection with Pastebee. We may
						discontinue Pastebee at any time at our sole discretion. When testing Pastebee, you
						acknowledge that we instantly and remotely collect statistical information about your
						actions and consent thereto. You grant us and our affiliates a worldwide, perpetual,
						irrevocable, royalty-free license to use and incorporate into our services any
						suggestion, enhancement request, recommendation, correction or other feedback provided
						by you relating to the operation of our services.
					</p>

					<p>
						We reserve the right to modify these User Testing Terms and Conditions at any time.
						These User Testing Terms and Conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with
						British law, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions.
